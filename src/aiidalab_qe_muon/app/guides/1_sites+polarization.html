    <li><b>Query</b> for LiF: : select Li and F elements in the interactive periodic table, and click the "Search" blue button (at the bottom). 
      Note: you might need to wait a few seconds while the widgets performs some basic queries to the OPTIMADE server, 
      until the periodic table gets activated from light blue to darker blue.

        before starting the muon spectroscopy workflows. In an case, the 
        plugin will perform relaxation of each supercell during the search for muon sites).

<div id="muon-settings">
  In the Muon settings panel, we can customize the muon parameters. 
  We will use value of the parameters
  in such a way to quickly perform simulation, not to obtain accurate results. For example, 
  we are not going to use a large enough supercell, and we are using a much coarser k-points grid with respect to the
  default one.

<div id="submission-step">
  <p>
    In the submission step, we define the computational resources to be used in
    the calculations. The global resources are used to define resources across
    all workflow calculations. Optionally, you can override the resource
    settings for specific calculations.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <b>Warning:</b> If running locally (for example, on the AiiDAlab demo
    server), we recommend keeping nodes and CPUs at the default minimum of 1
    each.
  </div>
  <p>
    Once the resources are defined, we can optionally customize the workflow
    label (pre-filled according to the settings of steps 1 & 2), as well as
    provide a detailed description of the workflow. Once we are ready, we can
    submit the workflow.

    You first need to select which code (code executable + computer where this 
    will run) to use for each step of the workflow. The Quantum ESPRESSO app 
    should always install a local Quantum ESPRESSO executable that is sufficient 
    for this tutorial, but you can setup additional codes installed on remote 
    supercomputers.

        Check the table and, for the lowest energy site (there will be only one site, label is A), compute the distance between the &mu; and the 
        F atom, by selecting the atoms in the structure viewer below the table 
        (just click on atoms to select/deselect them). The measured distance should be 2.21 Å, 
        and can be found in the panel on the right with respect to the structure view.
      </li>
      <li>
        Verify that indeed closest F atoms are repelled by the muon center (at variance with the case where the muon is charged);
        this can be easily seen in the <b>Distortion</b> plot, below the structure viewer.

        At which time does the relaxation function start to deviate from the Kubo-Toyabe one?
